# AWS SaaS Sales - Project Dawn

**Dataset Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnthanh101/aws-saas-sales/data

 🔍 **Situation:**

Following a decade of unprecedented expansion, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is navigating a complex shift in the global tech economy. In early 2026, Amazon announced "Project Dawn," a strategic restructuring involving significant layoffs aimed at streamlining corporate operations. Leadership has noted that while top-line revenue remains high, net margins are beginning to compress.

There is a growing internal debate: Are these compressed margins a result of inefficient sales behavior (over-discounting and poor rep performance), or are they driven by structural product failures (unprofitable SaaS offerings and high-cost segments)? Without a data-backed answer, the layoffs risk cutting productive talent while leaving unprofitable business units intact.

 📕 **Assignment:**

As a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst I have been brought into the "Project Dawn" task force, I have been assigned to audit 9,994 AWS SaaS transactions. My task is to dissect the relationship between Sales, Profit, and Discounts to identify Profit Leakage.

Internal stakeholders have asked me to  produce a diagnostic report that identifies whether the "leakage" is Human-Led (Sales Reps/Segments) or Product-Led (Sub-Categories/Pricing Models), alongside a Dashboard to display this.
